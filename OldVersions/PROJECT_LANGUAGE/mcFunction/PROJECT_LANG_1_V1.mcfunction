# For: MCPYE/CommandLanguage
# About:
# I decided to make mcfunction the main project language file for this project (MCPYE_CommandLanguage) as mcfunction is the language this project is dedicated to, as mcFunction is the core language that the Minecraft Python Edition command language builds off of. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
